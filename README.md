A parallelized genetic algorithm for finding approximate solutions to the traveling salesperson problem.

To compile, move into `src` and run `$ make`

Parameters: 2 million iterations, pop_size of 1000, 0.3 mutation_rate

The best result I found was 5862.06.

Run Time of best result (4 threads): 4.92 seconds (using timing method from class, see code).

Single-Thread Runtime: around 12-14 seconds.
